    Calculate the Euclidean distance between two points in 3D space.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    rA : array_like
        Coordinates of the first point as a numpy array or array-like object.
        Shape should be (3,) for 3D coordinates.
    rB : array_like
        Coordinates of the second point as a numpy array or array-like object.
        Shape should be (3,) for 3D coordinates.
    
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The Euclidean distance between the two points.
    
    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> point1 = np.array([0, 0, 0])

        Coordinates of the first point as a numpy array or array-like object.
        Shape should be (3,) for 3D coordinates.
    rB : array_like
        Coordinates of the vertex point (where the angle is measured) as a numpy 
        array or array-like object. Shape should be (3,) for 3D coordinates.
